<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This is a website that organises and manages elections. This website is developed to serve for elections of all scales: from the school elections (to elect school president) 
and aims to even work for the legislative assembly elections. 
<br>
<h5>How it works?</h5>
<br>
<b>Step 1:</b> Head of institution / organisation creates an election in this portal giving appropriate details<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> The voters may login using the access code given by the head of the institute to change personal details like passwords,etc.<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> The voters may vote for the desired candidate once the election is open<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Once the head of institute closes the election, results are published and winner is declared! <br>
</p>

<article id="supervisor">
<h4>The supervisor</h4>
<p>A supervisor (or head of the institute) is the one who creates the election and has direct control over its activities. He/ She has the powers of creating and stopping an election, removing or adding a voter in the voter list, and so on. In other words, the word "election" is an indirect reference to the superior authority- the supervisor<br>
<h5>How it works?</h5>
<br>
<b>Step 1:</b> Supervisor can create an election by filling a form<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Only the Supervisor can suggest the names of the candidates who are contesting in that election<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Upon successful creation of the election, the supervisor may login and check the names of voters who are enrolled. Any suspicious names can be detected and removed easily een before the election starts<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> After approval of voter list and candidate list, the supervisor may flag-off the elections. <br>
<b>Step 5:</b> After completion of the election, the supervisor may stop the election and print the results.

<article id="voter">
<h4>The voter</h4>
<p>the key to an election is the voter himself. His participation is crucial for the development of the organisation. A voter, here, means "any authenticated member of the organisation who holds the access code and hence has the right to vote"<br>
<h5>How it works?</h5>
<br>
<b>Step 1:</b> Voters receive an access code, a username and a pre-determined password<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Upon successful first login, the voter may modify his.her credentials for security reasons<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> The details of the election and its candidates are also on display, hence the voter may educate himself before voting<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Upon activation of the vote link, a voter may only vote once to his desired candidate <br>
